# Product Context: workbench-operator

## The Problem
Setting up a remote graphical workbench environment for researchers and developers can be complex. It often involves manually configuring servers, networking, and applications, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This complexity distracts users from their primary tasks.

## The Solution
The `workbench-operator` abstracts away the underlying infrastructure details. Users can define a `Workbench` custom resource with the desired applications and configurations. The operator then handles the creation and management of all the necessary Kubernetes resources to provide a fully functional, browser-accessible remote desktop environment.

## User Experience
- **Declarative Configuration**: Users define their workbench environment in a simple YAML file.
- **Automated Management**: The operator handles the lifecycle of the workbench, including creation, updates, and deletion.
- **Web-Based Access**: Workbenches are exposed via a web interface, allowing users to access their graphical applications from any modern browser.
